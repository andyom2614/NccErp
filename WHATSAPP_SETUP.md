For production, you'll need to:

2. Get your own WhatsApp Business phone number
3. Update the environment variables with production credentials

## Spreadsheet Integration

Currently using mock data in `whatsappService.ts`. To integrate with Google Sheets:

### Option 1: Google Sheets API
1. Enable Google Sheets API in Google Cloud Console
2. Create service account credentials
3. Share your spreadsheet with the service account email
4. Update `getAnoDataFromSpreadsheet()` function to use Google Sheets API

### Option 2: CSV Upload
1. Export your spreadsheet as CSV
2. Create an upload interface in the admin panel
3. Parse and store ANO data in Firestore

## Expected Spreadsheet Format

Your spreadsheet should contain the following columns:
- **Name**: Full name of ANO (e.g., "Lt. Rajesh Kumar")
- **Rank**: Military rank (e.g., "Lieutenant", "Captain", "Major")
- **WhatsApp Number**: Phone number with country code (e.g., "+91-9876543210")
- **Email**: Email address (must match the email in user accounts)

## Message Template

The WhatsApp message will be formatted as:
```

## Testing

1. Make sure you've joined the Twilio WhatsApp sandbox
2. Create a test camp notification with "ANOs Only" selected
3. Check your WhatsApp for the notification message

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Environment variables not loaded**: Restart the development server after adding .env file
2. **WhatsApp not received**: Check if you've joined the sandbox and the phone number format is correct
3. **API errors**: Verify Twilio credentials and account status

### Error Messages:
- "Twilio configuration missing": Check your .env file
- "No ANO contacts found": Verify ANO data and email matching
- "Failed to send WhatsApp message": Check Twilio account balance and sandbox status
